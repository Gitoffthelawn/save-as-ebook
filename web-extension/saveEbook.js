// ---- the stylesheets the archive carries -------------------------------------
//
// Two kinds of css reach a book, and only one of them is filtered by content.
// What extraction captures is scraped off somebody else's page, and supportedCss
// in extractHtml.js decides which of its declarations are worth carrying. What a
// user writes in the chapter editor is not that: it is theirs, it is meant to
// change how the book looks, and holding it to an allowlist would only mean most
// of what they typed silently did nothing. Nothing they can write in it makes the
// package invalid either - css a reading system does not understand is css it
// ignores.
//
// What this removes is neither of those judgements. It is the ways a stylesheet
// reaches outside the archive, which both kinds can do:
//
//   @import          pulls in another stylesheet, which for a remote address is
//                    a network fetch from inside a file that is supposed to read
//                    offline, and for a local one names a file the archive has
//                    no way to contain.
//   a remote address a background image or a font fetched off the network. EPUB
//                    requires a manifest item referencing a remote resource to
//                    say so (properties="remote-resources"), and this build
//                    makes no such claim about any file it writes - so rather
//                    than have the claim and the content disagree, the reference
//                    goes. Captured css hits this as well: 'list-style'
//                    serializes an absolute url whenever the page gave its
//                    bullets a picture.
//
// url() is not the only way to write the second one, which is why the work is
// done by a tokenizer in cssSanitizer.js rather than by a pattern here. That
// file states the whole rule and why it is that rule; this one only says which
// half of the result it wants.
//
// A url() that is not remote is left alone: "../images/photo.jpg" from a chapter
// stylesheet resolves to a picture the book really does contain, and using one as
// a background is a reasonable thing to want. data: urls stay for the same
// reason - they are carried in the file rather than fetched.

//   css    the book-wide stylesheet, written by the user in the chapter editor.
//          Absent, ebook.css is written empty, which is what it was for every
